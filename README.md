Project name: SimpleQuizProgram
IDE used: Apache NetBeans
Programming language: Java
Licence: None


Hi! This is the first project that I uploaded here 
on GitHub and the first project that I use Git on.

I built this project as a starting point 
for learning to code in Java.

What this program does is just a simple quiz program 
that gives you questions and you answer them. 
After you answer them, it will give you the 
results of the questions you've answered 
either correct or wrong.

One of the good things about this program is you 
can add as many questions as you want effortlessly.


How to run the program:

There are 2 ways:

1. Use Apache NetBeans or Netbeans:
>Go to the top right corner and go to File>Open project
>Then navigate to the folder where the project folder 
is located and click "Open Project"
>Go to the Project sidebar, right-click on 
the "SimpleQuizProgram" and click "Run".

2. Run using a terminal or the command prompt (cmd): 
First, you need to compile it and then you can run it.
(Note: you must have JDK installed)
>First open up a terminal.
>Then type "cd (project_location)/simplequizprogram/src"
Note: The (project_location) is where the project folder is 
located. For example: "cd C:\Users\YourUserName\Downloads\simplequizprogram\src"
>To compile it, type "javac Main"
>After compiling you will see files added in the directory that has a .class extension.
>Once done compiling, you can now run the program just by typing "java Main"
and you're done.
